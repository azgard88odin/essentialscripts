Hi all,

This repo is mainly for me to access certain scripts for quick access externally.
This is a small collection of scripts I have built in order to help me with some day-to-day tasks at work and at home.

The scripts are written in Bash, Batch (CMD), Powershell. These are just some that I wished to share, because maybe, someone else needs something I have made.

Below will be an explaination of each script found within. Some of these are pretty raw and I welcome any assistance with further development of them or even creating something new.

I will be updating this periodically so please excuse if I have not yet give descriptions to them all.
